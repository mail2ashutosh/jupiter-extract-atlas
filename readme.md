# Jupiter Extract Atlas
A tool to extract individual images from a texture atlas.

## Overview

**Jupiter Extract Atlas** is a tool designed to extract individual images from a texture atlas. It is particularly useful for game developers working with texture atlases generated by tools like TexturePacker.

This repository contains the pre-built executable (`.exe`) for running the tool and sample packed assets (dummy data) to demonstrate how the tool works.

## Project Structure
jupiter-extract-atlas/
├── packedAssets/ # Contains sample atlas image and JSON data (dummy)
│ ├── sample_atlas.png
│ └── sample_atlas.json
└── dist/jupiter-extract.exe# Contains the executable file for running the tool.

## How to Use

### Running the Executable

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mail2ashutosh/jupiter-extract-atlas.git

2. **Navigate to the `dist` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd jupiter-extract-atlas/dist
    ```

3. **Run the executable:**

    ```bash
    ./jupiter-extract.exe
    ```

4. **Provide Input:**

   When prompted, enter the names of the atlas image and JSON data file located in the `packedAssets` folder (without extensions):

   ```plaintext
   Enter Image Atlas name without extension: sample_atlas
   Enter Atlas JSON data name without extension: sample_atlas (json file)

5. **Output:**
   The extracted images will be saved in an output directory created alongside the packedAssets and dist folders.
